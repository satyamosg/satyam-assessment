Problem statement
-----------------
As someone who has just receieved lots of Christmas presents, I want to log who gave what to each member of my family so that I can send them thank you letters.

Each present should have:
- Who it was from
- Which family member it was to
- A picture of the item
- What it was
- How much I liked it (star rating)
- Date opened (date created stored in firebase)
- Thank you letter sent (checkbox)

There should be a link that generates a batch of thank you letters

Presents should be sorted sensibly and can have any look and feel.

Direct code reuse from previous projects is banned.

Your MVP must be completed by Friday 2pm where you will demo to a potential employer and should include

- Look and feel

- Firebase security
- Create items
- Update items
- Read items
- Delete items


You can bring 1 A4 piece of paper and will have access to the internet. Reuse of existing code written on the nology course is banned.
